# MK8 DELUXE DRAFT

A draft application that allows MK8 Deluxe players to draft characters, karts, wheels, and gliders for their next tournament. Users answer prompts on the start screen for draft set-up. The draft is then initiated. If a user does not select from a category within the alotted time, a pick is autodrafted for them. Results are displayed at the end of the draft. 

The deployed application can be found [here](https://deluxedraft.herokuapp.com).
